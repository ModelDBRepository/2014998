# Contributing 

1. **NEVER PUSH TO MASTER:** For each new feature you want to add, create a new branch.
2. When you want to merge a feature into the main branch, submit a pull request. 
3. Ask for code review by Abe when you want to merge into the main branch.
4. Add an _Issue_ if you encounter problems or if you want to add new features, todos, etc.
